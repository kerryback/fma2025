## Plan 

1. Example of what AI can do today - new Claude skill from September
2. Historical analogues?
3. Courses on AI
4. Updating existing courses to use AI
5. Assessing students

## 1. Example

::: {.quote-box}
Read the uploaded case (Valuing Walmart 2010).  Ignore the valuation method described in the case.  Instead, generate pro forma statements and perform a two-stage DCF analysis.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Document your assumptions and your reasons for them.  Generate an Excel workbook and a Word doc. Format the Excel worksheets nicely.
:::

## 2. Historical analogues

1. Handheld calculators
2. Personal computers

>How did teaching and learning change? Are there lessons for today?

## Calculators

- Much worry that students wouldn't learn addition, subtraction, ... 
   - Studies haven't found an effect 
   - But there are still assessments in primary schools where calculators are not allowed
- Some hoped that schools could move beyond calculation and teach deeper math 
  - That didn't seem to happen either

## Personal computers & spreadsheets

1. We added courses on how to use spreadsheets 
2. We updated existing courses to use spreadsheets
3. We assess how well students can use spreadsheets (no pencil and paper valuation analyses)

## Why did we do that?

- Spreadsheets are used in business
- Spreadsheets are ideal for teaching the logic of some things (valuation/capital budgeting)
- Spreadsheets don't automatically do the things we were teaching before (financial calculators $\rightarrow$ spreadsheets)

## What about AI?

✓ AI is used in business

✓ AI is useful for teaching/tutoring

✗ AI can automatically do many things we were teaching before

- Like calculators and students learning to calculate
- Need to have some assessments where AI is not allowed

## AI is used in Business

MIT/Media Labs State of AI in Business 2025:

::: {.quote-box}
Workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of
personal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some form for their work.

## Plan 

✓ Example of what AI can do today (new Claude skill from September)

✓ Historical analogues?

3. Courses on AI
4. Updating existing courses to use AI
5. Assessing students

## 3. Courses on AI

a. Cases on corporate implementation
b. Prompt engineering
c. Vibe coding for financial analysis 
d. Building apps, custom chatbots, agents

## a. An overview case

[Blazing New Trails: Responsible Generative AI and the Creative Adoption of a Large Language Model at Deloitte Canada](https://store.hbr.org/product/blazing-new-trails-responsible-generative-ai-and-the-creative-adoption-of-a-large-language-model-at-deloitte-canada/HEC382?srsltid=AfmBOoo8whYuCV6aPeMolvqA2FNyJJz0-l8D3oFSoKKObmqppQ_Y_QcO), 2024.

- Describes creation of a custom chatbot
- Discusses reliability, bias, compliance, data privacy, trust of customers


## b. Prompt Engineering

- Iterate, adding and revising, until we get what we want
- Clean up and save
- Fresh try using saved prompt, iterate more if needed
- Try on a new example, iterate more if needed 
- Something we can assess: "turn in your prompt"

## c. Vibe Coding

In March 2025, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and managing partner Jared Friedman stated that 

:::: {.columns style="display: flex; align-items: center;"}
::: {.column style="width: 1280%; display: flex; align-items: center;"}
::: {.quote-box}
for roughly a quarter of the startups in their Winter 2025 cohort, 95% of the codebase was written by AI.

## Vibe coding for financial analysis 

- Chatbots with python can easily do many types of financial analyses
- Running python in the cloud:
  - ChatGPT, Claude, Google Colab with Gemini, Julius.ai
- Running python locally:
  - VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code 

## d. Building stuff

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](ai_learning_progression_with_prompt.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
- Apps can use AI
- Chatbots are apps
- Agents are chatbots with tools
- Agents include database agents
:::
:::
::::

## custom chatbot is an app consisting of

- User interface
- API connection to an LLM, which has possibly been fine-tuned
- System prompt
- Possible retrieval of documents
- Possible use of tools

## System prompt is fundamental

- The simplest custom chatbot is an app that passes messages back and forth between a user and an LLM.
- The basic element that makes it a 'custom chatbot' is its system prompt.

::: {.quote-box}
A system prompt is text that is sent to the LLM along with each user prompt. It contains information and instructions for the LLM.
:::

## Custom Chatbot structure

![](chatbot.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}

## Agent = Chatbot + Tools

- AI agent is a chatbot equipped with tools to do things
- Claude and ChatGPT are agents - they can send code to Python environments
- Database tools are very useful for chatbots

## Claude for Financial Services

From [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services):

Through data providers, Claude has real-time access to comprehensive financial information:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
- Box
- Daloopa
- Databricks
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
- FactSet

## Aaron Linsky, CTO, AIA Labs at Bridgewater:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
We've been developing capabilities powered by Claude since 2023 within AIA Labs.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Claude powered the first versions of our Investment Analyst Assistant, which streamlined our analysts' workflow by generating Python code, creating data visualizations, and iterating through complex financial analysis tasks with the precision of a junior analyst.

## Why mba students should learn about agents

Fortune, 9-14-2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}

::: {.quote-box}
PromptQL, an enterprise AI platform created by San Francisco-based developer tooling company Hasura, is doling out <span class="highlight">$900-per-hour</span> wages to its engineers tasked with building and deploying AI agents to analyze internal company data using large language models (LLMs).
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Tanmai Gopal, PromptQL's cofounder and CEO, said "<span class="highlight">MBA types</span> ... are very strategic thinkers, and they're smart people, but they <span class="highlight">don't have an intuition for what AI can do</span>."

# Structure of Database Agents

## agent passes prompt from user to LLM

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](agent_v1.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
May require chatting at this stage to clarify user's request

## agent passes SQL from LLM to data warehouse

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](agent_v2.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}

![](agent_v3.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## What can we do in the classroom?

- Can have students vibe code apps for mean-variance analysis, cost of capital calculations, binomial-tree option pricing, ...
- Apps can include API connections to OpenAI, Claude, ...
- Apps can produce Word docs or PowerPoint decks with tables, figures, and written analysis from LLM
- Apps can include chat with LLM


## Yeyati, Brookings, 2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
As AI models begin to handle underwriting, compliance, and asset allocation, the traditional architecture of financial work is undergoing a fundamental shift.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
As job descriptions evolve, so does the definition of financial talent. <span class="highlight">Excel is no longer a differentiator. Python is fast becoming the new Excel. </span>
:::
::: {.quote-box}
But technical skills alone will not cut it. The <span class="highlight">most in demand profiles today are those that speak both AI and finance</span>, and can move between legal, operational, and data contexts without losing the plot.
:::
:::

## How do we teach it?

- We just need to expose students to what is possible 
- AI can do the rest
- Example: ask ChatGPT or Claude to 
  - create an example Streamlit app
  - explain how to deploy it (for free) on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Plan 

✓ Example of what AI can do today (new Claude skill from September)

✓ Historical analogues?

✓ Courses on AI

4. Updating existing courses to use AI
5. Assessing students


## Demos (all vibe coded) 

- [Rice Business Stock Market Data Portal](https://-portal.rice-business.org)
- Claude MCP server for the data portal

## How to grade?

- Our graduates must be able to prompt chatbots and evaluate and refine the work of chatbots.
- Replace "turn in an Excel workbook" with "turn in a chat, what was produced by the chat, and your evaluation of the product."
- Assign what used to be a group project as an in-class exam with AI assistance allowed.

## Prompt example 4 (Replit)

::: {.quote-box}
Create a retirement planning app that allows a user to enter (i) current account balance, (ii) annual savings (constant), (iii) years to retirement, (iv) mean and standard deviation of annual returns.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Simulate normally distributed annual returns for 1,000 lifetimes and present an analysis, including a density plot of final balances and percentiles.  Highlight the mean and median on the density plot.
:::

## Prompt example 5 (colab)

::: {.quote-box}
Create a streamlit app in which the user inputs a ticker, and the app calculates a beta for the stock and produces the scatterplot as done for WMT before and also implements the following:
:::
::: {.quote-box}
My ngrok access key is stored as a secret key.  Use it to deploy the app.
:::


## prompt example 6 (colab)


::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
Add the following functionality to the streamlit app:
:::
::: {.quote-box}

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbots 

- Break documents into chunks (~paragraphs, overlapping)
- Calculate vector embedding of each chunk based on some embedding scheme
- Calculate embedding of user prompt.  Find similar chunks.
- Send prompt and chunks to AI model.
- <span class="highlight">Key element of many corporate AI implementations</span>

## Example RAG chatbots

- Google's Notebook LM
- Can vibe code your own from class materials or [textbook](https://book.derivative-securities.org)


# AI Agents



# Incorporating AI into Teaching

## Chatbots 

- Obviously, students already use chatbots
- <span class="highlight">We should encourage them to use chatbots even more</span> - for idea generation, planning work, and doing work (for which they are responsible, of course)
- ChatGPT, Claude, etc. write and run Python code to do numerical calculations, so hallucinations are not really a problem.* 

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
*Except that they sometimes think it's OK to use <span class="highlight">synthetic data</span> without telling us, instead of the data they are instructed to use.
:::
## sequence of instruction 

- We generally teach concepts first with slides (or board)
- Then show in tools (usually Excel)
- Now, there is a next step: chatbots

- Runs in terminal or can use as chat assistant in VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.

## Claude Code capabilities

- Create, edit, copy, move, delete files
- Write and run Python scripts and notebooks
- Write and build Latex documents, including beamer

##

- Create and edit Word docs and PowerPoint decks
- Create, edit, and render Quarto docs for web pages and html slides
- Create GitHub repos and push and launch apps on hosts (Koyeb, Render, ...)
- And you can chat with it about anything

## Demo claude code prompt

::: {.quote-box}
Create a LaTeX doc in the article style with Hello World as the title.  Compile to pdf.
:::

- It's even more helpful  when used in VS Code etc. (which are full-featured LaTeX/Python IDEs)
- Do this analysis and generate a figure or LaTeX table and insert it into the document ... Read this paragraph and suggest improvements ... Make these global edits ...
