## Plan 

1. Example of what AI can do today - new Claude skill from September
2. Historical analogues?
3. A course on AI
4. Updating existing courses to use AI
5. Deep dive into Claude Code

## 1. Example (prompt for Claude)

::: {.quote-box}
Read the uploaded case (Valuing Walmart 2010).  Ignore the valuation method described in the case.  Instead, generate pro forma statements and perform a two-stage DCF analysis.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Document your assumptions and your reasons for them.  Generate an Excel workbook and a Word doc. Format the Excel worksheets nicely.
:::

## 2. Historical analogues

1. Handheld calculators
2. Personal computers

::: {.quote-box}
How did teaching and learning change? Are there lessons for today?
:::

## Introduction of Handheld Calculators

- Much worry that students wouldn't learn addition, subtraction, ... 
   - Studies haven't found an effect 
   - But primary schools still provide practice and assessments in which calculators are not allowed
- Some hoped that schools could move beyond calculation and teach deeper math 
  - That didn't seem to happen 

## Introduction of Personal computers & spreadsheets

1. We added courses on how to use spreadsheets 
2. We updated existing courses to use spreadsheets
3. We assess how well students can use spreadsheets (no pencil and paper valuation analyses)

::: {.fragment}
>Teaching how to do finance in spreadsheets is a main goal.
:::

## Why?

- Spreadsheets are used in business
- Spreadsheets are ideal for teaching the logic of some things (valuation/capital budgeting)
- Spreadsheets don't automatically do the things we were teaching before (financial calculators $\rightarrow$ spreadsheets)

## What about AI?

✓ AI is used in business

✓ AI is useful for teaching/tutoring

✗ AI can automatically do many things we were teaching before

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}
AI is more like calculators than spreadsheets.  We worry that students won't learn skills that they need.  

Like primary schools and arithmetic, we will need to have practice and assessments in which AI is not allowed
:::
:::

## AI is used in Business

MIT/Media Labs State of AI in Business 2025:

::: {.quote-box}
Workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of
personal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some form for their work.

3. A course on AI

4. Updating existing courses to use AI

5. Deep dive into Claude Code
:::

## 3. A Course on AI

a. Case on corporate implementation
b. Prompt engineering
c. Vibe coding for financial analysis 
d. Building apps, custom chatbots, agents

## a. case on corporate implementation

[Blazing New Trails: Responsible Generative AI and the Creative Adoption of a Large Language Model at Deloitte Canada](https://store.hbr.org/product/blazing-new-trails-responsible-generative-ai-and-the-creative-adoption-of-a-large-language-model-at-deloitte-canada/HEC382?srsltid=AfmBOoo8whYuCV6aPeMolvqA2FNyJJz0-l8D3oFSoKKObmqppQ_Y_QcO), 2024.

- Describes creation of a custom chatbot
- Discusses reliability, bias, compliance, data privacy, trust of customers


## b. Prompt Engineering

- Some students ask for instruction on how to prompt AI
- Special techniques aren't needed.  Practice is.

Ethan Mollick, Wharton, "Good Enough Prompting:"

::: {.quote-box}
Treat AI like an infinitely patient new coworker ... As it is a coworker, you want to work with it, not just give it orders, and you also want to learn what it is good or bad at ... Working with AI is a dialogue, not an order.
:::

## The roles of AI

- Do stuff for us
- Collaborate with us
- Advise us

## Building an effective prompt to do stuff

- Have a dialogue with AI until we get what we want
- Save clean instructions in form of Step 1.  Step 2. ...
- Fresh try using saved prompt, iterate more if needed
- Try on a new example, iterate more if needed 
- Claude valuation example is a good place to start: build an effective prompt to generate valuation analyses

## Aaron Linsky, CTO, AIA Labs at Bridgewater:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
We've been developing capabilities powered by Claude since 2023 within AIA Labs.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Claude powered the first versions of our Investment Analyst Assistant, which streamlined our analysts' workflow by generating Python code, creating data visualizations, and iterating through complex financial analysis tasks with the precision of a junior analyst.

## c. Vibe Coding

In March 2025, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and managing partner Jared Friedman stated that 

:::: {.columns style="display: flex; align-items: center;"}
::: {.column style="width: 40%; display: flex; align-items: center;"}
::: {.quote-box}
for roughly a quarter of the startups in their Winter 2025 cohort, 95% of the codebase was written by AI.

## Vibe coding for finance

- Chatbots with python can easily do many types of financial analyses: regression, mean-variance optimization, binomial-tree option valuation ...
- Running python in the cloud:
  - ChatGPT, Claude, Google Colab with Gemini, Julius.ai
- Running python locally:
  - VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code 

## d. Building stuff

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
- Apps can use AI
- Chatbots are apps
- Agents are chatbots with tools
:::
:::
::::

## chatbot is an app consisting of

- User interface
- API connection to an LLM, which has possibly been fine-tuned
- System prompt
- Possible retrieval of documents
- Possible use of tools

## System prompt is fundamental

::: {.quote-box}
A system prompt is text that is sent to the LLM along with each user prompt. 

It contains information and instructions for the LLM.
:::

[Anthropic's System Prompts](https://docs.claude.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#august-5-2025)

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbots 

- Send stored chunks of documents to LLM along with prompt and system prompt
- Choose chunks most relevant to the prompt
  - Vector embedding (vector store)
  - Similarity search
- Key element of many corporate AI implementations

## Chatbot structure

![](images/chatbot.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}

## Agent = Chatbot + Tools

- AI agent is a chatbot equipped with tools to do things
- Claude and ChatGPT are agents - they can send code to Python environments
- Database tools are very useful for chatbots

## Claude for Financial Services

From [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services):

Through data providers, Claude has real-time access to comprehensive financial information:

## Why mba students should learn about agents

Fortune, 9-14-2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}

::: {.quote-box}
PromptQL, an enterprise AI platform created by San Francisco-based developer tooling company Hasura, is doling out <span class="highlight">$900-per-hour</span> wages to its engineers tasked with building and deploying AI agents to analyze internal company data using large language models (LLMs).
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Tanmai Gopal, PromptQL's cofounder and CEO, said "<span class="highlight">MBA types</span> ... are very strategic thinkers, and they're smart people, but they <span class="highlight">don't have an intuition for what AI can do</span>."
:::
:::

## Yeyati, Brookings, 2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
As AI models begin to handle underwriting, compliance, and asset allocation, the traditional architecture of financial work is undergoing a fundamental shift.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
As job descriptions evolve, so does the definition of financial talent. <span class="highlight">Excel is no longer a differentiator. Python is fast becoming the new Excel. </span>
:::
::: {.quote-box}
But technical skills alone will not cut it. The <span class="highlight">most in demand profiles today are those that speak both AI and finance</span>, and can move between legal, operational, and data contexts without losing the plot.

## What can we do in the classroom?

- We can show students how to vibe code apps to automate things 
  - Getting data
  - Financial analysis
  - Getting written analysis from AI 
  - Producing Excel, Word, PowerPoint
- App can include chat feature to clarify which data to get, which tools to use, ...

## Tools

- Point and click: ChatGPT's Custom GPTs
- Simplest vibe coding environment: Replit
- Google Colab for Streamlit app and ngrok deployment
- Local: VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code



## How do we learn this stuff to teach it?

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; height: 500px;"}
<span style="font-size: 3em; font-weight: bold;">Ask AI</span>
:::
:::


## Plan 

✓ Example of what AI can do today 

✓ Historical analogues

✓ A course on AI

::: {.quote-box}
4. Updating existing courses to use AI

5. Deep dive into Claude Code
:::


## 4. Updating existing courses: what we should teach 

- We generally teach concepts first with slides (or board)
- Then show in tools (usually Excel)
- Now, there is a next step: chatbots and agents

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}
Teach about implementation in Excel $\rightarrow$ students build Excel models.

Teach about implementation in AI $\rightarrow$ students build prompts or apps
:::
:::

## How we should teach

- AI is a very effective tutor
- We should take advantage of it
- <span class="highlight">Asking students to chat with chatbots can replace "Do the assigned reading."</span>
- Can be assigned before class or in class before slides.

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}  
Ask your chatbot to teach you about ... Be sure to tell it to ask you questions to ensure you are understanding.
:::
:::

## Controlling the sources 

- Build RAG (Google's Notebook LM or Custom GTP or ...)
- If sources are copyrighted, first ask AI for a complete report on the subject, read and edit the AI report, and add to system prompt "Teach from this report ..."

::: {.fragment}
But this is probably unnecessary for most topics.  The LLMs are much, much more reliable than they were a couple of years ago when everyone was concerned about hallucinations.
:::

## How can we assess?

::: {.fragment data-fragment-index="1"}
- Out-of-class assignments should become "turn in your chat, its output, and your evaluation of the output" or "turn in your app."
:::

::: {.fragment data-fragment-index="2"}
- In-class <span class="highlight">exams without AI</span> to ensure students understand concepts
:::


::: {.fragment data-fragment-index="3"}
- In-class <span class="highlight">exams with AI</span> that are more ambitious than exams today.  Cases can become exams with AI assistance.

## Claude Code

- Probably not for students, but for research and teaching prep
- Uses standard Anthropic models, but seems to have a great system prompt
- Runs in terminal or can use as chat assistant in VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.

## Claude Code capabilities

- Create, edit, copy, move, delete files
- Write and run Python scripts and notebooks
- Write and build Latex documents, including beamer

##

- Create and edit Word docs and PowerPoint decks
- Create, edit, and render Quarto docs for web pages and html slides
- Create GitHub repos and push and launch apps on hosts (Koyeb, Render, ...)
- And you can chat with it about anything

## Demo claude code prompt

::: {.quote-box}
Create a LaTeX doc in the article style with Hello World as the title.  Compile to pdf.
:::

- It's even more helpful  when used in VS Code etc. (which are full-featured LaTeX/Python IDEs)
- Do this analysis and generate a figure or LaTeX table and insert it into the document ... Read this paragraph and suggest improvements ... Make these global edits ...
